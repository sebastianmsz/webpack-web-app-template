# Web App Webpack Template

This is a template for creating a web app using webpack.

## Features

-   Bundles JavaScript, CSS, and other assets using webpack.
-   Supports hot module replacement for faster development.
-   Includes a development server for testing your app locally.
-   Optimizes and minifies your code for production.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   Node.js
-   npm

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sebastianmsz/web-app-template.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open your app in the browser.

4. Build your app for production:
